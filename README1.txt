### Step 1: The Paddles

This is the first thing we'll put on the screen. We will make a blueprint for the paddles and then create two paddles from it.

* **Make the Blueprint (`Paddle` Class):**
    * Create a class called `Paddle` that gets all the powers of a regular `Turtle` (by writing `(Turtle)`).
    * Give it an `__init__` method to set its shape, color, and size.
    * Make sure it starts in a specific position on the screen.
* **Create the Paddles:**
    * In the main part of your code, create two new `Paddle` objects, one for each side of the screen.

Once you have done this, run your code to see the two white paddles on the screen. This is a big first step!

### Step 2: Making the Paddles Move

Now that we have the paddles, let's make them move with the keyboard.

* **Add Movement Methods:**
    * Go back to your `Paddle` class and add an `up` method. This method should move the paddle up by 20.
    * Add a `down` method to move the paddle down by 20.
* **Connect Keys to Movement:**
    * In the main part of your code, set up the screen to `listen` for keyboard presses.
    * Use `screen.onkey()` to connect the `"Up"` and `"Down"` arrow keys to the movement methods of your paddles.
    * You'll also want to turn off the screen tracer (`screen.tracer(0)`) and use `screen.update()` inside a `while` loop to make the movement look smooth.

When you're done with this step, you should be able to move both paddles up and down using the keyboard.

### Step 3: The Ball and Collision

Now for the most important part of the game! We need a ball to hit.

* **Make the Ball Blueprint (`Ball` Class):**
    * Create a new class called `Ball` that also inherits from `Turtle`.
    * Give it an `__init__` method to set its shape, color, and starting position.
    * Create a `move` method to make the ball move continuously.
    * Create a `bounce_y` method to make the ball bounce off the top and bottom walls.
    * Create a `bounce_x` method to make the ball bounce off the paddles.
* **Add the Ball to the Game:**
    * In the main part of your code, create a `Ball` object.
    * Inside your `while` loop, call the ball's `move` method.
    * Add an `if` statement to check if the ball hits the top or bottom wall and call `ball.bounce_y()`.
    * Add another `if` statement to check if the ball hits a paddle and call `ball.bounce_x()`.

Once you finish this step, the ball will bounce around the screen, and off your paddles, but the game won't end yet.

### Step 4: The Scoreboard and Winning

This is the final step to make it a full game!

* **Make the Scoreboard Blueprint (`Scoreboard` Class):**
    * Create a new class called `Scoreboard` that inherits from `Turtle`.
    * Give it an `__init__` method to set up the scores and write them on the screen.
    * Create `l_point` and `r_point` methods to update the scores when a point is made.
* **Finalize the Game Logic:**
    * In the main part of your code, create a `Scoreboard` object.
    * In your `while` loop, add `if` statements to check if the ball has gone past a paddle. If it has, call the correct `Scoreboard` method to add a point and then reset the ball's position.

That's it! By completing these steps one at a time, you will have a fully working Pong game. Would you like to start with Step 1 and have me help you write the code for the `Paddle` class?
